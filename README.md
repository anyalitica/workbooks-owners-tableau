# workbooks-owners-tableau
This Python script allows you to programmatically login to Tableau Server / Tableau Online, build a list of workbook owners, and export it as a .csv file. 

The script uses [Tableau Server Client library](https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/) to interact with the [Tableau Server REST API](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api.htm).

Created as a part of the [Tableau #DataDev Mini-Challenges](https://www.tableau.com/developer/mini-challenges).
